//-1. Design patterns
    // -> typical solutions to common pronlems in software design, e.g. Adapter, Model View COntroller (MVC), Strategy
        // : language independent

//-2. MVC
    // -> stands for Model View COntroller, a software architectural design pattern.
    // --> promotes code organization, separates app function into 3 group, Model group, View group and Controller group.

    //-2.1 Model Group -> protect the data from the crush
        // -> contain all the business, data and database logic

    //-2.2  View GROUP 
        // -> user sees in the browser or app. (U.I);
        //    contains of HTML/CSS ahd front-side JS

    //-2.3 Controller Group

    // Advantage: 
        //- work parallel on different components of MVC,
        //- decouple various components,
        //- increases the code reusability
